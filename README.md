# HELOC Process Improvement Case Study

## Project Overview
This project focuses on redesigning the Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) application tracking experience for bankers at our financial institution. The goal is to streamline the tracking process, close critical skill gaps, and enable bankers to deliver faster, more accurate service through a fully redesigned UX/UI platform.

## Problem Statement
- The current banker-facing HELOC platform is fragmented and difficult to use.
- Bankers must switch between multiple apps and screens to:
  - See current file handler (processor, underwriter, closer)
  - Read comments/notes (in another section)
  - Check applicant follow-up tasks (in a different app)
  - Monitor application deadlines via periodic email reminders
- Lack of consolidated visibility leads to:
  - Poor user experience (UX)
  - Process confusion and errors
  - Skill gaps for bankers unfamiliar with back-end process flow

## Goal
To develop a new **live tracker app** that:
- Provides a **full lifecycle visual map** of the application.
- Highlights the **current stage** in real time.
- Clearly lists **pending tasks** with deadlines.
- Displays **upcoming stages** and related stakeholder actions.
- Reduces reliance on fragmented apps, notes, and email reminders.

## Approach
1. **Needs Identification**: Gather insights from frontline bankers, processors, and underwriters.
2. **Requirements Gathering**: Define what bankers need to see, trigger, and track within one platform.
3. **Process Mapping**: Map the "As-is" (current) process and "To-be" (optimized) application lifecycle.
4. **Solution Evaluation**: Design UX/UI wireframes for the new app; evaluate integration options with back-end processing systems.
5. **Validation & Testing**: Build UAT scripts; test usability with a pilot group of bankers.
6. **Implementation Support**: Create training materials and rollout plans.
7. **Monitoring & Optimization**: Capture banker feedback and usage analytics post-launch.

## Success Criteria
- 80%+ banker satisfaction score on new platform usability.
- 50% reduction in application status-related errors.
- 30% improvement in banker response times to applicant needs.

## Artifacts
- Requirements documentation (BRD, user stories)
- Process flow diagrams (current vs. future state)
- Wireframes and UX mockups
- Sample dashboard design (progress tracker)
- Change management and training plans
- Monitoring KPIs and feedback collection strategy
